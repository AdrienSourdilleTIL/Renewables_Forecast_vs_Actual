# Renewables Forecast vs Actual

This project analyzes and visualizes the accuracy of renewable energy forecasts compared to actual production across various sources (solar, wind, etc.) in France.

## üîó Data Pipeline

We collect raw data daily from **RTE (R√©seau de Transport d'√âlectricit√©)** using **two API calls**:

1. One to retrieve **forecast values**
2. One to retrieve **actual production values**

These values are stored in standardized **Common Data Model (CDM)** tables. Each day, a new CDM table is added.

The data is then:
- Cleaned and aggregated using Python
- Used to generate a series of insightful visualizations

## üìä Visualizations

### 1. Total Forecast vs Actual (MW)

![Total Forecast vs Actual](charts/total_forecast_vs_actual.png)

Compares the total forecasted renewable production against the actual production over time.

---

### 2. Forecast Error Over Time (MW)

![Forecast Error Over Time](charts/forecast_error_over_time.png)

Shows when production was over- or under-estimated.  
**Green = overproduction**, **Red = underproduction**.  
Labels show the MW delta for each day.

---

### 3. Forecast vs Actual by Production Type

![Forecast vs Actual by Production Type](charts/forecast_vs_actual_by_type.png)

Displays forecast vs actual production for each renewable source type over time.

---

### 4. Average Forecast Error by Hour

![Forecast Error by Hour](charts/forecast_error_by_hour.png)

Shows the average percentage error by hour of day, aggregated across all available dates.

---

### 5. Forecast Bias by Production Type

![Forecast Bias](charts/forecast_bias_by_type.png)

Visualizes which sources are consistently over- or under-forecasted on average.
